Before moving to Taipei nearly two years ago I, like many other Americans, viewed my own
monolingualism with a vague sort of shame. After all, most people from other first-world countries
often knew at least two languages: namely English and their own mother tongue. I felt that I was
missing out on another world that only those who knew two or more languages were able to experience.

Besides three years of Spanish in high school, I had very little experience learning or
using a second language. While three years may seem like a long time, I assure you that the
extent of my studies was woefully deficient. Later on I found that I could have covered all three
years of Spanish study in a couple months of after-work study.

So when I moved to Taipei, my main goal was to learn Mandarin. Rated as one of the toughest
languages to learn for English speakers,
I knew that I had my work set out for me. After nearly two years of intensive
self-study, I have reached the point where I can converse, understand most TV shows, and even
read simpler Chinese literature without too much of a struggle. My Mandarin, while good compared
to many other foreigners here, is still not great and I continue to work every day to improve it.
Nevertheless, I have finally joined the numerous ranks of those who know and practice a second
language.

To my surprise, I found that most of the difficulties in learning Mandarin lay not in the language
itself, but the environment here in Taipei. For example, most people who met me would rather speak
to me in English rather than Mandarin. I initially thought this was due to the insufficiency of my
own Mandarin, but found that it continued even after my Mandarin reached a point that was better
than the English of whoever I was talking to.

This caused me quite a bit of consternation and led me to reflect and compare my experience of
using Mandarin in Taipei to my own conception of how it is to use English in America. The
monolingualism of Americans slowly transformed in my mind from a mark of shame to a, likely misplaced,
badge of honor. I think many aspects of America that people praise: the friendliness of the people,
the inclusion, and so-on, are actually somewhat tied to our monolingualism. I hope to convince you
of this case.

### No language power struggles

John Pasden, who has learned Mandarin to a level far above what I could ever hope to reach,
has a great article about [language power struggles][1] that I re-read often
during my time here. In it, he talks about how when deciding which language two parties who are
multilingual to use, it usually comes down to whichever will best facilitate communication. Duh!
This usually comes down to picking the language that both parties are least-bad at when you sum
up the language level of the two parties.

This law is also why most people who learn Chinese in Taipei are frustrated and give up. In order
for their language to reach a level that is even NEAR the English of an average college graduate
here, they will need to study full-time for at least a year, if not two. Most Taiwanese from
my generation will all have hade around a decade of English classes by the time they graduate college.
The stakes are not tilted in your favor. 

In America, by contrast, most people only know English. If you are a Mandarin native speaker and
go to American, there will be no language power struggle because there will be no alternative
choice at play. This means that those with quite bad English will be able to participate in 
broken conversation and slowly improve through this sort of immersion. 

Of course, there is the other side of the coin: Americans in Taiwan can always fall back on English,
which makes traveling and living here much easier comparatively. Taiwanese in America do not have
this safety net, increasing the stress of travel and living there substantially. But the fact is
that such "sink or swim" scenarios will result in more people "swimming" their way to medium levels
of English fluency. And that safety net is why nearly every foreigner here has bad to non-existent Mandarin.

### Inclusion

By lowering barriers to participation, a more inclusive environment is made. That is not to say
that the Taiwanese are not inclusive people - far from it. They are perhaps some of the most
inclusive and welcoming people I have ever met. However, intention and reality often have a way
of diverging.




### Communication and 

### Accent accommodation

A common complaint of those who learn Chinese in Taiwan is how often they will encounter responses
of "I don't understand" even after having learned Chinese for many years. In fact, my little brother
a month or two ago shared with me a [post on Reddit][1] about someone encountering this very same
situation. Despite having used Chinese successfully in China for many years, he encountered 
friction when trying to use Chinese in Taiwan.

It is often not due to the insufficiency of one's Mandarin knowledge, but instead due to the
thickness of the accent. The fact is, many Taiwanese often struggle to understand Mainland accent
which I personally find quite clear compared to the Taiwanese accent, despite having ONLY watched
and immersed in the Taiwanese accent the entirety of the past two years! Taiwan is a very small
country with a lack of different accents. Nearly every Mandarin speaker a Taiwanese encounters
is from Taiwan and has the same accent as them.

China, being a much larger country with a wide variety of accents and regional languages, is
apparently (according to the linked post) much more flexible in this regard. The average Chinese
in a big growing city will encounter people and accents from all over the country.

I often contrast this with my experiences working in tech in Seattle. I had many colleagues with
extremely thick accents that bordered on being beyond understandable. However, I was still able to
understand each word they said in the end, even if I needed to ask them to repeat one or two there.
As we say in America - "po-tae-toe, po-ta-toe". Pronounce "potato" nearly any way you like and we
will usually be able to understand it. I think our ability to understand foreign accents is often
underrated!

Admittedly, this is only indirectly tied to monolingualism. Monolingualism generally will encourage
those who migrate to use the majority language, and those accents (along with loan words) will
slowly become assimilated and accepted into the majority language. Or so goes the theory.

### Utility

One of the biggest disappointments of learning Mandarin in Taipei has been the complete lack of
utility it presents. Despite living in a primarily Mandarin-speaking environment, I find that my
Mandarin skills gives me only a marginal utility. This is mainly due to the great English of the
residents of Taipei. However, I also found that in my time traveling around Asia previously, that
even when there was no shared language I was still able to communicate well enough with pointing
and other gestures.

Of course, if one is interested in learning ...

The fact is, English is perhaps the only language that has clear utility for everyone, regardless
of location. It is the predominate language of the web, wide swaths of scientific literature,
and is of course the lingua franca of our age.

Aside from Spanish, which is useful towards the south of America, learning other langauges simply
does not present the same sort of utility as learning English does for those who live in other
countries. Presented with this, moralistic appeals of "we OUGHT to learn a language" strike me as
sort of skirting around this main point. The vast majority of Europe does not learn English out of
some sort of greater good, but for the sake of its utility.

I learned Mandarin not for utility at all, so I am not saying that a language MUST have utility for
it to be learned. 

### Cultural strength

When I think of countries whose citizens are known for having somewhat deficient second language
skills, I also happen to find many countries that have a compelling cultural strength. Aside from
the Anglosphere, some other countries that come to mind include Japan, Russia, and France. Not to
mention most of Latin America.

To take France for an example, it is a not uncommon experience for someone to travel to Paris and
to encounter friction due to their inability to speak French. The French take a pride in their
language, and expect those who visit - and certainly those who stay long term - to make _effort_
in learning the language. While I have heard many tales of frustration (and my own experience was
such) of encountering this aspect of traveling there, I have heard an equal amount of tales of
those who learned a little French here and there and had a much more welcoming experience. 

I posit that a culture is tied, at least partly, to language. As such, 

## Conclusion

I hope I have convinced some of the benefits of American monolingualism. That said, I am not in any
way advocating for Americans to never try to learn another language! My experience learning Mandarin
has been really eye-opening and rewarding, and I certainly hope everyone can experience
learning another language.
